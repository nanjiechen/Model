% ADAPT_SPARSE_GRID computes an adaptive sparse grid approximation of a function f:
%
% ADAPTED = ADAPT_SPARSE_GRID(F,N_FULL,KNOTS,LEV2KNOTS,PREV_ADAPT,CONTROLS)
%
% computes a sparse grid adapted to the approximation of a function F: \Gamma subset R^N_full \to R^V 
% according to some profit indicator. The implementation closely resembles the algorithm proposed in
%
% T. Gerstner, M. Griebel, Dimension–Adaptive Tensor–Product Quadrature, Computing 71, 65–87 (2003)
%
% and the various definitions of profits are discussed in 
%
% F. Nobile, L. Tamellini, F. Tesei, and R. Tempone, An Adaptive Sparse Grid Algorithm for Elliptic PDEs 
% with Lognormal Diffusion Coefficient, Sparse Grids and Applications – Stuttgart 2014,

%
% Roughly speaking, at each iteration the algorithm considers the multiidx with the highest profit
% among those already explored, adds it to the sparse grid, computes the profits of all its neighbouring 
% indices (see controls.prof) and adds them to the list of explored indices.
% 
%
% --> F is a function-handle, taking as input a column vector (N_full components) and returning a column-vector value (V components). 
% 
% --> N_full is a scalar, denotes the dimension of the space \Gamma over which F and the sparse grid are defined.
%       Note that this is the full dimension, yet the algorithm might explore a smaller subset of variables to
%       start with, N_curr, as specified in CONTROLS.var_buffer_size (see below)
%
% --> KNOTS, LEV2KNOTS are the quantities defining the knots to be used in each direction (same family of
%       knots assumed in each direction of the space Gamma)
%
% --> PREV_ADAPT: by setting PREV_ADAPT as the output ADAPTED of a previous computation, the new computation
%       will resume from where the previous one left. Set PREV_ADAPT = [] for a fresh start
%
% --> CONTROLS is a struct defining several parameters that control the algorithm flow. It is possible to
%       define only some (or none) of these parameters, the others will be set to default value. Only
%       the parameter 'nested' is mandatory. The parameter 'pdf' is mandatory only if controls.prof is
%       set to any of the 'weighted*' choices (see below). For safety, 'pdf' is not set to default and
%       an error will be raised if the field is not set
%
%       controls.nested   : (mandatory) true if nested points will be used, false otherwise
%
%       controls.max_pts  : is the maximum number of points the adapted sparse grid can have (default 1000).
%                           Observe that if the max nb of points is reached while checking the neighbours 
%                           of the current idx, the algorithm will not be interrupted.
%
%       controls.prof_tol : the algorithm will stop as soon as profit of the considered idx is smaller
%                           then prof_tol (default 1e-14)
%
%       controls.paral    : parallel computation is used as soon as at least <paral> function evaluation are
%                           needed
%
%       controls.recycling: can be set to 'priority_to_evaluation' (default) or 'priority_to_recycling'. This affects
%                           only when non-nested points are used. Because in this case points enter and exit
%                           from the sparse grid, we should keep a record of all points that have been
%                           evaluated and recycle from it whenever possible. However, doing this exactly is **very
%                           expensive** in terms of computational cost with the current data structure if N is
%                           large. So, unless your function evaluation is **very** expensive, we recommend to
%                           leave the default setting, which does a "partial search", i.e. searches for
%                           recycling only in the previous grid (instead than on the entire sparse grid
%                           history) and therefore implies that the same point might be evaluated multiple times.
%
%       controls.prof     : chooses how to compute the profit of an idx. In general, this entails comparing
%                           the sparse grids approximation of f *before* adding idx to the sparse grids (call 
%                           this approximation S) and *after* having added it (call this approximation T).
%                           Note that S, T are actually functions of y in \Gamma and return a vector with V components
%                           (same as f, the function to be approximated). In general, profit takes either of the two forms
%                                 
%                                 P(idx) = Op_y ( Op_vect(S,T) ) ,  P(idx) = Op_vect ( Op_y(S,T) )
%             
%                           where Op_vect acts as a "vector norm" over the V components of S,T (e.g., the euclidean norm for
%                           fixed y), and Op_y acts as a norm over Gamma (e.g. the maximum over a discrete set of values of y).
%                           Currently, the choices below are available. In all of these choices, Op_vect can
%                           be changed by setting the field controls.op_vect (see below)
%
%                               'Linf'                      :   P(idx) = Op_y( Op_vect(S(y),T(y) ) where
%                                                               Op_vect(S(y),T(y)) = euclidean norm of S(y) - T(y) for a fixed y; 
%                                                               Op_y = max over a discrete set of points of Gamma.
%                                                               For nested points, the algorithm considers the points that would
%                                                               be added to the grid by the considered idx,
%                                                               evalutes the function and the previous sparse grid on such
%                                                               points, and takes the max of such difference
%                                                               as profit estimate. For non-nested points, the sparse grid approx
%                                                               is not interpolant, hence we consider the difference between both the
%                                                               *new* and the previous sparse grids on the new points.
%
%                               'Linf/new_points' (default) :   the 'Linf' profit estimate above is further divided
%                                                               by the number of new points considered

%
%                               'weighted Linf'             :   same as 'Linf', but the difference between

%                                                               multiplied by the probability density function (see below for details).

%
%                               'weighted Linf/new_points'  :   the 'weighted Linf' profit estimate is divided by the number of new points

%
%                               'deltaint/new_points'       :   the 'deltaint' profit estimate is divided by the number of new points

%                            where A B are two matrices with V rows, containing the evaluation of the two operators S T discussed above

%
%       controls.pts_tol   : is the tolerance used by evaluate_on_sparse_grid to check for equal points (default 1e-14)
%
%		controls.pdf       : pdf over Gamma \subset R^N_full, the set over which the sparse 
%                            of the random variables, to be used in weighted* profits. It must be provided
%                            as a function handle that takes as input a matrix with N rows (for generic N), i.e. where each column is a point
%                            where the pdf must be evaluated. For instance, if the weight is the standard gaussian

% --> ADAPTED is a struct containing the results of the algorithms. The same structure can be passed
