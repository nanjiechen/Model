% this function expresses L as a function of the standard Legendre polynomial (i.e. polynomials orthogonal in -1,1 w.r.t to rho=1 !! ),
% which are recursively calculated through the function standard_lege_eval, coded below in this .m file

% first compute the transformation of x in (a,b) to t in (-1,1)

t = ( 2*x - a - b ) / (b - a ) ;

% calculate the standard legendre polynomials in t

L = standard_lege_eval(t,k);

% modify L to take into account normalizations

st_lege_norm = sqrt ( 2 / (2*k+1) );

% moreover, add an additional sqrt(2) to take into account a general interval (a,b) , not (-1,1)

L = sqrt(2) * L / st_lege_norm;
